`pvta-transit-streaming` was a real-time tracking service for PVTA (Pioneer Valley Transit Authority) buses in Amherst, Massachusetts. The system provides live updates on bus locations, arrival times, and route information to help students and residents navigate the local transit system more effectively. We built this as a course project for Systems for Data Science (CS 532). The goal of this project was to primarily learn more about event-driven architectures and dablle with Kafka for the first time!
