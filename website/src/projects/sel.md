`sel` is currently a training-free workflow to identify and link salient entities in web pages (primarily news articles). The system is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to integrate into existing workflows.

This work is my independent research in collaboration with Apple. This could very well take a completely different turn in the coming months :)
