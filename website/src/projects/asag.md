`asag` is an Automatic Short Answer Grading System I developed during my time as a ML Research intern at C-MInDS, IIT Bombay. The system uses NLP techniques to evaluate student answers based on semantic similarity to model answers. I extracted linguistic and embedding-based features, experimented with six cosine similarity variants, and applied regression models on the Texas dataset, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models.
