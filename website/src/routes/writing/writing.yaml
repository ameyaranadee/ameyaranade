      It's a rainy morning. I sit up in bed, open my eyes just a little to see the drizzle. The streets are still wet from last night, and the sky has forgotten what colour it wants to be. I watch droplets race down the window, leaves dancing with a gush of wind. I hear sirens from the hospital next to my building. If I close my eyes, I can almost remember the smell of rain in Mumbai. My mom puts it best, “ek olava asto hawe madhe". I get up and go about my morning as usual. It's a Sunday morning, there's no rush, no hurry. It's as if time has slowed itself down for me. I move around at a snail's place, brushing my teeth as if everyday were a Sunday. I've grown a certain bond with Sunday mornings.

      I distinctly remember the smell of rain on a Sunday morning, or how I’d cozy up in my blanket with that chill in the air. I miss the view from my old window as it rained. Leaves glowing green, parrots perched on the katta, eating rice grains from our bird feeder. 

      On those Sunday mornings, the world outside my window always seemed washed clean. Leaves shining, the air still, and parrots perched in our balcony, pecking at rice grains in the bird feeder. I no longer have that window, or the parrots but my heart remembers how it felt. If I close my eyes, I can almost see myself back home, with Aai making fodnichi poli and Baba sitting cross-legged on the floor, reading the newspaper. I put on a sweater, pack a book, and some notes and leave with no destination in mind. I hop on a train, and sit by the window. I stare into nothing, I watch trees and brick buildings pass. It's been a few months now, and I'm still surprised by how I can just ride a train into New York City at will, as if I'm inching closer to my dream, one station at a time. I walk around West Village, and into a cafe. I sit down as the faint smell of coffee fills my nose. I will never understand people who drink cold coffee. I can't think of a better feeling than a hot cup on a cold rainy morning. Maybe it's just me. There's a comfort in being part of the city yet slight apart from it, a comfort in being just another stranger lost in thought. There are droplets on the window, and I have no worry in the world. Not a single one. My thoughts are all I have, they are everything that defines me.

      Sometimes I wonder if existence needs a purpose at all. If there is none, I’m okay with it. There’s something almost freeing in that thought. It means I can simply be and move through the world on my own terms. I can breathe, read, write and think, without being answerable for it. Whenever I picture this life, I never see code or deadlines. I see rain, pages, ink and coffee. Almost a trance. I see my mind wandering to the farther corner of the world and return quietly. If there's no grand purpose to existence, maybe the only purpose is to endure it gracefully. To find small ways to soften the weight of it all. 

      Maybe that’s where the disguise begins, not in hiding but in softening. Not the kind that fools others, but the kind that fools yourself, just enough to hold it all together. I guess we learn to slowly fold pain into politeness, silence into composure, and uncertainty into small, careful gestures. Everyone carries a universe within themselves, full of choices and secrets, fears and failures. In revealing one, we hide the rest.

      I catch myself doing that often. Saying “no worries” when there are, in fact, plenty. Smiling through exhaustion. Nodding along to conversations I’m not really following. Sometimes it’s easier than explaining. Or maybe it’s a habit. Over time, the mask becomes so familiar that I forget it’s there. I used to think I had to solve it all, that honesty meant tearing down every wall, saying everything out loud. But now I think honesty also lives in restraint. Sometimes, disguise gives us time. Time to hold the pain softly until it’s light enough to release.

      It’s strange how you can tell a truth when no knows for sure if its yours. Like me, hiding my thoughts in these letters. I realize that writing itself is a kind of disguise, a way to speak without fully revealing. Maybe because words give me control. I get to decide what’s written. Maybe thats what this is - my disguise, a kind of translation if you will. To turn what's real into something gentler, something I can hold without it hurting too much. Hiding in plain sight. Building layers, only to peel them off more gently, more deliberately. I’m hidden in these spaces, in the pauses, in the half formed thoughts, and in everything I could never say out loud. I'm starting to think there really is an art to disguise. Not just towards yourself, but towards others. There's love too, in disguise. Like playing a song she doesn’t like so she knows I remember. Brushing off her compliment with a joke. Walking slower to match her pace. Sending a photo of something ordinary because it reminded you of them. Saving the last bite. Making that extra cup of coffee. Highlighting lines and tucking notes in a book you’re returning. In a world full of grand gestures, material and show, there's a hidden art to disguise. A subtle, softer way of being. It’s the softness that steadies you when the world feels sharp. The kind that doesn’t seek to impress but to preserve. It’s in how we speak gently when we could shout. How we listen more than we explain. How we learn to make peace with what cannot be fixed. Maybe that’s the art to disguise, a quiet strength, a kind of tenderness we wear to survive the noise. A calm defiance that refuses to harden.

      And yet, every disguise has its cracks. A tremor in the voice. A pause too long. A shaking hand. A sigh between words. The way eyes betray what words refuse to. I think truth has a way of leaking through. What makes disguise beautiful is when it slips and someone doesn’t flinch. When they just sit beside you and let you be. No fixing, no cheering. Just quiet presence. Or absence. Maybe that’s the real art of disguise, letting your storm settle within you as you peel away the layers slowly. Knowing when the world needs your smile, and when you do.

      An essay on somewhere, a cabin.

    content: |
      Sometimes, back home, when I’d be sitting in my room, at my desk, staring blankly at my laptop while the world around me went on, I’d think about taking a year off and traveling the world. To get lost and be found in the quiet of unfamiliar towns. To write stories from train stations and tiny cafés. To make friends with strangers I’d never meet again, and find pieces of myself in their passing presence. For some reason, I always thought I’d do it at 30.

      My mom would laugh it off gently, in a way only mothers can. As if to say, we all think we’ll do things when we’re 30. And then life sneaks in. Bills, heartbreak, love, groceries, deadlines. Dreams get tucked away into our closet, as if they were sweaters, waiting to be chosen in winter. But I never saw it that way then.

      I had somehow convinced myself that the world would bend to my wishes. That the version I’d built in my head was the one waiting for me. And yet, a part of me is afraid. Afraid I’ll spoil it. As if the version in my head is perfect because it only lives there, in my imagination. What if, when I finally stand in those streets I imagined, they feel hollow? What if I’m too tired to notice the beauty, too anxious to be present? What if the dream was never meant to be touched?

      There’s always been this strange barrier between me and the people around me. Not distance exactly, but a separation, like looking at the world through glass. I can see them clearly. I can feel everything that they are, but they can’t quite reach me. I carry that feeling everywhere, and I don’t know where it comes from. Or when it began.

      Every time I let myself speak freely, without pretending, I feel a strange sensation within me. My body warms up. My chest lightens. My mind flickers, and I start to shake. As if I’m one with some strange truth. But even then, I pull back. I snap out of it. As if staying in that space for too long might reveal too much.

      The truth is, I don’t want to paint life as beautiful all the time. I carry around a quiet sadness, some wordless weight ever present. Maybe that’s why she felt safe around me. I don’t ask to fix things. I just sit with pain she won’t admit. Just hold it. And in holding hers, I learned how to hold mine too.

      But often my mind wanders, travels across oceans. Wanders to a world where I’m more like the characters I read about. Larger than life. Brave. Messy in ways that make for good stories.

      To a world where I’m a struggling actor, fiercely in love with my craft, reading plays and writing poems late into the night. To a world where I’m a traveler, filling picture books with faces and pinning each place I visit onto a map that covers my walls. A quiet reminder of all the places I’ve been, and all the versions of myself I met there. To a world where I’m a photographer, capturing people in their pauses. Not just smiles, but silence. Struggle. A breath. To a world where I write songs and sing under stars. I imagine walking onto empty stages with a guitar and a heart full of things I don’t yet have words for. 

      But more than anything, I travel to that cabin. In my mind, it’s by a river, or a waterfall. Someplace where the only sound is that of the water flowing. The windows are wide, always open. I’m surrounded by trees and I sit by the window with my cup of coffee. I smell like old pages, and the air smells like mud and quiet nostalgia.

      Inside, the shelves are full of books, and there are no clocks, no alarms. I write pages of nothing, sometimes something. I cook. I speak out loud as if the voices in my head are now in front of me. I let time pass without trying. I become one with whatever it is this world is. Outside, the water keeps flowing, infinite. 

      Maybe that cabin isn’t really a place, but a feeling. A state of mind. A version of myself I’m growing into. Someone who’s made peace with his own chaos. And for a moment, I become him. Even if only for a moment, I step outside the lines I was handed. Maybe that’s the sensation within me. As if that version of myself reaches out to me. Holds me. So that, just maybe, when I’m finally sitting in my cabin, I’ll know how to stay. And if I don’t, atleast I’ll have it all written down.

      An essay on leaving Amherst.
    link: '#'
    content: |
      The last few months after graduation have felt like a lifetime stretched thin across a string of days, a strange in-between. From friends leaving, then parents, to interviews and rejections, and finally to me packing up and leaving, I’ve felt all kinds of things. Some too fleeting to remember, some heavy enough that I carried them along with me to a new city. But somewhere along the way, I’ve learned a little more about myself.

      In hindsight, I’m glad I stayed back in Amherst for just a little while longer. Amherst, with its forever-keeps-you-guessing skies and slow, uneventful days, gave me room to pause. As someone once told me, I’m the kind of person who tends to look inward, ruminating, reflecting, and reminiscing, rather than pushing to shape the world to fit my expectations, into something it’s not. On top of that, staying off social media reminded me of that too. It reminded me that all these apps, though loud and urgent, are rarely a reflection of our realities. It reminded me of the people and things that matter the most. I’d recommend the break, if you haven’t tried it already.

      This week, I packed up most of my things and moved out. It’s strange how my entire life fits into three suitcases and a few boxes. That’s all it takes. A few bags, a key returned, and suddenly a chapter ends. What stayed behind, though, and is harder to pack away, is a suitcase full of memories I’ll carry with me, always.

      Sometimes, I think about how far we’ve all come. From our cities in India to staying in a remote college town miles away from civilization and even further away from everything that was once familiar. Having lived all my life in Mumbai, I had never known silence to be this loud. I’d also never known how comforting a small college town could be. Another recommendation if you haven’t lived in one before. There’s something about it, it’s oddly hard to put into words. I’m trying though.

      It’s been almost two months since graduation. Time slips by easily these days, or maybe I’ve just stopped paying attention. Isn’t it strange how we “pay” attention? Like it’s a currency. Not money, not time, but attention. Attention is the real currency of life. And yet, I have to admit, I often spend it on the past, wondering if things could’ve gone differently, maybe better. But in this moment, all I feel is gratitude. These suitcases may carry all that I own, but the people I met, that’s what I carry closest. That’s what I’ll take with me, wherever I go.

      I’m so glad I met every single person I did during my time in Amherst. I loved every meal we cooked, every laugh on our weathered couch, every drink, every song we screamed into the night. I’ll always remember the football games every week, whether under a blazing sun or in the middle of pouring rain, and the 5Ks we always trained for only in the very last month. I remember washing dishes in the dining halls, serving food with sore feet and sleepy eyes, and then running around like kids in the snow just a few hours later. I remember chasing down every free cookie and every slice of campus pizza like it was treasure, and standing in line for Bollywood nights at Monkey Bar, half-frozen and buzzed. Festivals and Secret Santas made me feel closer to home, hell, I remember sitting at my desk and, for a moment, feeling as if I was back in my room in Mumbai with my parrots on the window. Little pockets of warmth in our puffers. 

      So many little moments scattered here and there, somehow strung together into something I’ll never be able to name, but will always hold close. Maybe life is this now, suitcases and boxes. We pack up, we move, we settle again. We grow. We leave parts of ourselves behind and carry others forward. We change. Over and over again.

      I keep circling back to this line, “Life, we realize too late, is in the living, in the tissue of every day and hour.” And maybe that’s the hardest part. Knowing it’s already happening, even as we keep reaching for something more. We’re all out in the real world now, scattered across cities and time zones, chasing dreams, adulting and just learning how to be. But I hope we never forget to look around. I hope we keep making space for joy, for quiet, for each other and most of all, for ourselves.

      And if nothing else, I hope we remember that sometimes, even when it feels like everything’s changing, there are suitcases we carry that don’t look like luggage at all. Some are filled with stories, folded between laughter and longing, tucked away and waiting to be remembered. Not everything makes it into a box. But the best things never needed to. And some, well, some things we only find again when we stop to look back.

      An essay on popping bubbles.

    content: |
      Some nights I sit with myself restless and overwhelmed, my foot tapping against the floor, my head unbearably heavy. Tonight is one of those nights. I’m sitting here in my bed like I have for quite some time now. Yet tonight feels strangely different. As I look into the future, I stare blankly into the darkness that stares right back at me. I’m sure a lot of us have felt this quiet confrontation within ourselves. 

      I used to avoid this question entirely by never allowing myself to be alone for long. For years, I numbed myself with endless rabbit holes, seeking an escape from the chaos that lived around and within me. I let myself live in bubbles. Small worlds that I let myself believe were everything I needed. Maybe life is simply that, nothing but building bubbles. Around people. Around dreams. You blow and blow until you’re dizzy with hope and expectation.

      The funny thing about bubbles, though, is that they inevitably pop, leaving behind a void. There’s a certain emptiness in the aftermath, a silence so loud. What do you do when something so full of life suddenly disappears? I sit in that space, quiet and still. I close my eyes and wait.

      I end up scribbling these words, trying to string together these broken streams of thoughts. And as the night goes on, I find it harder to hold on. I look for ways to calm myself, but I fail. For nothing can truly soothe me except the bubble living on. My feet still nervously tap as I’m trying to fight these thoughts. Watching yourself struggle against your own mind feels absurd.

      Maybe life isn’t about finding bubbles that stay but about learning to let them go. About making peace with the pop. That sometimes the air left behind is enough. Maybe the point isn’t to fill every void right away. Maybe we were never meant to live inside them, but to learn how to breathe again. Maybe that’s where the strength lies. Not in the building, but in surviving the ruptures. 

      Some nights, just like this one, I won’t find the answers. Maybe I’ll just stay here with the weight, take in the silence and trust that the next bubble will be gentler. Maybe life isn’t about escaping the noise or filling every silence but learning to sit in it and breathe through it. And perhaps then, after everything settles, I can pop a bubble myself, watching it disappear softly into the night. Knowing another will form soon.

    content: |
      These words that I’m writing now have been bouncing around in my head for days. Maybe weeks. Perhaps even months. I can never tell. They’ve taken the shape of so many different emotions; longings I can’t quite define.

      When I was really small and chubby, there were nights I couldn’t fall asleep. Baba used to carry me around the living room, chanting Atharva Shirsha. He says, I’d drift off on his shoulder in a jiffy. I guess he misses the times when my face fit in the crook of his neck, and how my entireenter body eased into his embrace.

      My childhood feels like a distant memory now, sort of like a dream I was once a part of. I’m not sure how much I can trust myself when it comes to matters of the past, but I choose to believe the stories they tell me. Even my parents may not remember everything but I guess they are my best bet, they are the rightful keepers of my story. 

      I think I’m starting to understand why they keep repeating the same stories about me. Why baba keeps saying that I used to be his Undir mama, or why my mother keeps reminding him that I was actually her Waghoba. I think they keep repeating the same stories not just for me, but for themselves too. To hold on to my dream for as long as they can.

      I wonder sometimes if my childhood is slipping through my fingers. Adulting has such a tight grip on me now, that I can’t shake it off. I can’t escape. I’m trapped in this cage I’ve built for myself, this cage of expectation. My own constant lofty desire to fulfill this intellectual expectations I have of myself. This constant desire to be someone. To do something. To do everything all at once. And yet, the more I try to hold on to this dream of mine, the more it slips away. 

      I guess their stories help me stay connected. As though building a bridge between who I once was, and who I’ve now become. Maybe that’s why it all keeps coming back to me—when baba’s ever so loud voice goes soft with nostalgia, or when my mother’s laughter travels oceans and continents to reach my heart and make it dance. Maybe, that’s when some parts of me surrender to this reminder that no matter how much I change, there will always be parts of me that are still theirs.

      Isn’t it strange? How people who knew us before we knew ourselves hold onto fragments of us we can’t recall. I may not remember falling asleep on baba’s shoulders, but somehow whenever I close my eyes to try and remember, I see his white jhabba as he paces in the living room, and my tiny little head on his shoulder.

      These seemingly small moments form a small piece of this enormous puzzle that is my life. And yet, without them, this puzzle will always remain incomplete. Maybe that’s why even though time moves forward, I still circle back to my childhood. Maybe its always there, weaving its way through my days, even now.

      Maybe this is what it means to grow up? To hold onto and carry these tiny, forgotten pieces of your puzzle, as you keep trying to find new ones to fit alongside them. Somehow I find this thought comforting. Whispers from a time when the world felt smaller still tug at me with invisible strings. 

      They remind me that even if I don’t have all the answers right now, even if I haven’t yet become the person I imagine myself to be, I’ve always been someone they held onto. Even if I couldn’t see it then. Maybe in this silence, in this quite space between me and the universe, even though the details are blurry and I can’t really remember whether those stories are true, I learn that long before I learned to chase my dreams, I was a part of theirs.

      An essay on shards of glasses.

    content: |
      That’s what I spent most of my childhood doing, consumed by my own thoughts. Walls up, doors closed. I can’t remember a lot from when I was a kid, moments and memories are scattered everywhere like pieces of glass on the floor. Somebody spilled their drink and the glass has hit the floor. The glass has shattered, and the shards are now everywhere. And here I am now, stuck. Trying to walk my way through this mess, through this chaos without getting hurt. I can obviously avoid the larger shards. The obvious ones. I can see them, I notice them. It’s easier to walk my way around them. It’s the smaller pieces that get me every time. Invisible but yet so sharp. I can’t avoid them, like I can avoid the big ones. I’m not aware of them. I dance this delicate dance, take a step forward, land my foot on the surface thinking that it’s clean, that it’s safe, but little do I know. I land on a small piece, and it pierces right through my skin. Enters my body. It’s too late now, I can’t avoid it anymore. 

      The damage is done, and I’m bleeding already. I’m trying to find something to cover this wound, something to cover my bare skin. My memories rush back with every dripping drop of blood. Ever so slowly, they are making me dizzy. I don’t remember who spilled their drink, or how they spilled it. I walked my way through shards all this while, not knowing when I’ll bleed next. In doing so, I became ever so conscious of my surroundings, watching every step unknowingly. I kept tiptoeing my way in every room I entered. I wish I had realized sooner that I had entered a room clear of glass. I was oblivious. In my mind, any room I walked in always had shattered glass all over the floor. I wish somebody had warned me earlier. Warned me that I no longer needed to tiptoe. Warned me that I could in fact forget about the shards. I finally convince myself that there is no glass around. That when the time comes and the shards are no more, I can walk with my feet firmly placed on the floor.

      It’s unfamiliar, unknown. And suddenly, uncomfortable. I realize I’ve never known this feeling. This freedom. I remember wanting to feel like this, but now that I do, I don’t really know what to do with it. I’m growing restless now, anxious. It’s unsettling. I want someone to tell me that it’s okay. I wish I knew how to grow familiar with the unfamiliar, comfortable with the uncomfortable. I had learnt how to avoid those big pieces, and in doing so I thought I had learnt how to avoid them all but I never knew what to do when… there were no pieces at all. I didn’t realize when I became the one spilling the drinks and shattering glass all over the floor. I’ve spilled my drink again, and I’m sat on the floor with shattered glass all around me. This is what is known to me. What I once feared, defines me now. I was always afraid to touch the pieces, and now I’m one of them.

      I went to our spot today. The pond’s still there but the water felt closer this time, almost as if it wanted to reach out and touch me. It even has tiny little waves dancing on the surface. The birds are chirping so loudly, I can’t hear the music in my ears. I feel a strong desire, a pull in my chest. A yearning that’s so strange yet so familiar. It weakens my heart, my chest pains. But only slightly. It’s not too cold out here. I’m standing under our tree. I don’t want to sit here without you. Or without you reading my palm. Holding it ever so softly with your fingers. I never thought I could feel that light. Like a feather. The tree is still here, its leaves whispering softly with the wind. I look at the clouds. It feels like they are slipping away from me. So I call for them. To stay. I want this moment to stay. Still. I don’t want to capture it, I just want to be in it. This moment feels like a hug. I’m mustering the courage to sit. I’m doing it as I write. I sit down. It’s getting dark out here. The clouds are gone. Birds are still chirping in the distance. But I don’t mind. I could sit here for hours looking at this barren land in front of me.

      I want to lie down but like that day, I feel a small fear in me. As if somebody might walk in from behind and ruin this moment for me. I look back to check. But there’s no one. I’m still paranoid, a dull ache in my chest. It feels heavier now, like a stone. It’s getting colder as well, I’m shivering. It sucks that I can’t stay in this place forever. That I can’t look at the water and wonder where it came from. Or where it is going. 

      This feeling is unusual, this place even more. The wind is growing stronger. My hands are getting cold and I can’t type anymore. But this feeling even though unusual, seems familiar. I sit in this place alone, calm and quiet. While this place continues to be and continues to change. I have absolutely no hold over it but somehow commands something deep within me. I feel powerless but I’m okay with it. I can see a few stars now. They seem to smile at me, so I smile back. I smile like I always do, it’s my curtain. Nothing to see behind. Or beyond. So I smile and slowly, I start to forget. 

      I start to walk away but before I do, I stop. I close my eyes and let the moment sink in one last time. Like a whispered secret between me and this spot. I know I’ll come back one day. I know I’ll come back to this fleeting stillness. And when I do, I hope the stars will be right here, waiting for me.

      Have you found yourself getting lost in someone’s account on instagram and feel like even though you don’t know that person you actually do? Isn’t it funny? If I run into that person on a random Saturday morning, it’ll be very likely that all we have to say to each other is a simple hi. Yet somehow when you see them, you think about whether the person really is the one in the pictures? Am I the only one in relationships with instagram accounts? Or is it us all? Or can we actually spend a Saturday morning together? In a cafe somewhere? Or on a bench in the park? Even if it’s gloomy outside, would you have coffee with them? If you really are the average of the five people you spend the most time with can I count these accounts in it too? 

      I’ve found myself getting lost in someone’s instagram account to the point where I feel like I know that person when I in reality, I really don’t. I find myself smiling at their captions as if I’m in the pictures. Isn’t it funny? If I run into that person on a random Saturday morning, chances are all I’d manage to say is a simple hi :) And walk past them. Is it just me? Or could we actually spend a Saturday morning together? Maybe in a cozy cafe somewhere? Or on a bench in the park? Even if it’s almost freezing and depressingly gloomy, will I get out of my bed to have coffee with them?  If I really am the average of the five people I spend the most time with can I count some instagram accounts too?

      An essay on kindness.
    link: '#'
    content: |
      I think everyone who’s ever lost someone has, at least at one point in their life, wished that they could have been kinder. Kinder to the person who passed, kinder to the moments they shared. You wish you were kind enough when it mattered. And you wish your words and your actions stood testimony to that. But I guess you are kind. It’s just the moments that are unfair. They mask all the good that you try to do. In every choice you make, there is a choice that looses.

      The difficult thing to do perhaps is to be kind in the moment. Nobody really teaches you how to be kind. And I feel it’s such a wrongly defined word too. Do you know what kindness is? I feel most people think about kindness as this transaction between two people on different scales of the society.

      But I don’t agree. I don't think I can really count the times I've been kind. I wish we had a tally for all the kind choices we've made so far. Would have been warm on a bad day. I'm sitting here trying to recollect and nothing comes to my mind. As if I’m searching for evidence to tell myself that I’m kind enough. And kind when it matters. Why can I count the regrets then? I wish I knew. Perhaps regrets are just a memory of moments like any other, with all the good parts kind of peeled off.

      Slowly with time, I feel you realize that kindness is not a virtue. Nor is it a quality. It has nothing to do with character. Kindness, I’ve come to realize, is simply a choice like any other, a decision in the moment, regardless of recognition. Does that make any sense to you?

      I don’t like to think of life as a zero sum game. What goes around doesn’t always have to come around. Because in doing so we inadvertently admit the cruelty within us. In doing so, we don’t give each other a chance to be kind. To ourselves. To each other. And to the moments that we share.

      An essay on selling Honda City.
    link: '#'
    content: |
      My parents told me that they are selling our car today. The red Honda City. Every indian middle class family's car. I got the keys to her in 2022, when we sold our i10. It hurt then to sell the i10 because I learned driving in an i10. It felt mine. But I wasn't complaining. I forgot about i10 very easily. When i was driving i10, it was about wanting to drive the City. Then, I got the City and it was about driving the Harrier. It's only recently hit me. How the nature of life is to change. And funnily enough, cars in an indian family are the most appropriate representation of change. Every 4-5 years, there will come along a car in your life that will change things in a stupid little way. Sometimes it's more leg space, sometimes more boot space. It's funny how whenever we buy a car, we compare it's features.

      But when we sell it, we realize we never really cared about the features in the first place. We never really cared if the car had a touch-screen infotainment system. Or a retractable sunroof. Or the 23 other features that made it sound like a better choice than it's lower model. In fact, buying a car in itself is such a process. Going to showrooms and waiting in a glass room for someone to come in and take you to show their collection. After looking at the car from all angles, you sit in the car, you see all the features. My dad would always sit in the driving seat and check the steering wheel. He'd adjust the seats to be in the optimum position. As if he's going to be driving the car right away. My mom would always go sit in the back seat. And think about how many people this car can fit. Because that's what mothers do.

      They think about how many relatives this car can handle. Apparently the more the merrier. I would go sit in the passenger seat and immediately connect my phone's bluetooth to the touch-screen display. Because I always knew that a new car meant I'm the shotgun for atleast as long as my dad feels comfortable driving the car. Only when he himself is comfortable with the car, would he let me drive it. Because that's what fathers do. They take the fall so that you don't have to. Buying a car in itself is such a process I'm telling you. For so many years, the only thing I did was connect my phone's bluetooth to the car. I don't know when it stopped being the only thing that mattered to me. I slowly started to care about how many people the car would fit too, for the time when I would take my friends along.

      I don't know when I started to care about the seats too, adjusting it for my optimum position. As if i was going to drive the car right away. I don't know when it stopped being only my dad taking the test drive. Now, we have two laps. And everytime we've taken a test drive, my dad has asked the dealer whether we can go a bit further than we're allowed to. Because obviously, we have to test the car on the highway. And not in the stupid traffic. And the dealer would hesitate and say that it's not really in his control. And then my dad would convince the dealer that technically we're not really going that far. That we're still in the permitted kilometer range. Then we'd take the car back and discuss all it's pros and cons. All the way on the ride back home in our honda city. Amidst all this, we'd never think about the time when we'd sell this car.

      Maybe a lot of people don't care about a car so much these days. But cars have always been the pride of an indian family. But I know I'm not going to miss the touch-screen display or the comfortable leg space. I'm going to miss the time I spent driving the car with my friends on the backseat and my best friend riding shotgun. And the infinite preboozes. And me telling my friends to not spill a single. fucking. drop. Like my dad did when I was a kid drinking the leftover pepsi from the theater. I'm going to miss the time when I would drive my parents to malls for shopping or a movie. I'm going to miss the long drives. I'm going to miss the times when I drove with my best friend to turf. From mulund to thane. Not a lot, but I can still feel myself driving the car and looking out the window and being lost in thoughts. Thoughts like these.

      I can still imagine myself putting songs on 25 and screaming out lyrics not thinking about anything else. It'd be just me and my car and my songs. And it'd be everything I've ever needed. And then the next day when my dad took the car, he would set the volume back to 9. Because I'm a maniac who listens to songs so loud. But these are the stupid little things you miss when something is yours. And now the car will go on to another family. And they will have their own stories with it. Their own stupid little things. And that's beautiful. I think.

      An essay on Aaji cha kapat.
    link: '#'
    content: |
      After months of deliberation, baba found the courage to bring out aaji's godrej steel kapat today. It's sat there for months since aaji passed. As if it had lost its purpose somehow. Quite symbolic of aaji's last year with us. Its paint was chipped in places. As he opened the kapat, its doors creaked and the musty smell of old clothes and mothballs filled the room. I saw the pile of sarees lying there, untouched for months now. Each saree, a story in itself. Plastic bags haphazardly strewn across the partitions, and her favourite orange jute bag that she took to the bhaji market, hung over a hook. The Kalanirnay calendar stuck on the left side using a double sided tape.

      She had a collection of Iodex balms, her remedy for all kinds of aches and pains. Every time she saw me limping, she'd say 'iodex laav, patkan bara vaatel'. I didn't know I'd miss such trivial moments. In the bottom rack, she kept my old photo albums. Each picture a reminder of a moment lost in time, but captured forever in those pages. A sense of nostalgia washed over me. I remember I used to sit on the floor and remove the albums one by one. I'd look at the pictures, smile and pass the album over to her.

      Then she'd look at them and talk about how cute I was. But today, baba sat on the floor and flipped through those same albums. I wanted to sit on the floor again. He casually said that I used to be a free soul back then, laughing and dancing with no worry in the world. I smiled at that. I remember, I made soft copies of most of the pictures from the album during covid. I shouldn't have done that. After that, I never sat on the floor and flipped through those albums again. Maybe I should have. I had unknowingly robbed her of those moments.

      I'm sure she'd have loved to look at those albums for the thousandth time again. Maybe that was when she knew she was passing. To irrelevance. Maybe that's when she realised that she had more to look back on than to look forward to. I wish I'd have been more benevolent. It's been exactly a year now since I last saw her. But somehow, that’s not how I want to remember her. So I close my eyes. And I see her smiling, proud. And then, I immediately open my eyes because that’s how I’d rather remember her.

      I remember, in her last few months, her sodium levels constantly fluctuated. She couldn't think straight, she repeated things. Over and over again. But she had her fixed bedtime routine. She'd call out to me and ask me to switch on the 10-watt bulb in her room. 'Zero cha laav na'. To this day, I don't know why she called it 'zero'.

      Then I'd remove her hearing aid and carefully place it in her box. I wasn't allowed to misplace it. As a rule, I was to then place the box next to her pillow. Not an inch here or there. Beside her comb, hair ribbon and spectacles. She'd ask me to check if everything is still there. Multiple times. It was funny how she'd chosen these four items as her most precious possessions. If I told you to select four items most precious to you, what would you choose?

      Funnily, ever since she passed, I’ve started using my own ‘zero cha bulb’. And then I wonder how her kapat must feel now, as it sits there waiting in the corner, yearning to be noticed again. With every creak of its hinges, it whispered the tales of a lifetime lived. For within its depths lay a window to a world that once was. It is a testament to the past, her legacy.

      sound of the waves

      sunlight on the ocean makes the surface look like a satin cloth

      i close my eyes and imagine how you’d look in a satin dress

      and i smile slyly and feel silly

      that even in the middle of nowhere you have all my attention

      there’s something surreal about being surrounded by nothingness

      your senses are heightened 

      you can smell the salt in the sea

      you can feel the wind in your face

      you can see the rocks 

      and the tiny fishes

      lost in the vast expanse of the ocean

      just like me and you

      lost in this world

      belonging to nothing 

      trying to find meaning

      you hold on to the railing

      as the ride becomes violent

      and the waves get stronger

      that’s when you know who’s in control

      it was never you

      the ocean is too powerful 

      the rocks are immovable 

      it was never you

      it will never be you

      so there’s a moment of fear

      my heartbeat races and panic surrounds

      i close my eyes again

      to see if the image of you in a satin dress

      can calm me down

      but i see nothing this time

      when suddenly a shining beam of light falls on my face

      and i open my eyes 

      only slightly

      to see a lighthouse

      and suddenly feel safe

      I feel a certain calmness when I peek out my uber driving at full speed on the highway at 2 am. I know my life’s fucked and that it's technically monday morning. But I don't care. For, in that moment, I couldn’t care less about you. I feel light. Like a feather. It doesn’t matter where I’ve come from. Or where I’ll go. The only thing that matters is that I am. I feel at ease as i scream local train songs with my friends sitting uncomfortably in the rickshaw we got on our 43rd attempt. After a night of drinking and dancing, the polluted air of this city purifies me. A friend asked me today if I’ve ever felt happy internally. If I've ever felt at ease, not because of anything external but because of something within. And I thought of this. This city. The one I’ll leave someday. But will this city ever leave me? This city that's given me everything I have. That made me dream. This city, my whore. It gives and I take.  A city where I constantly find myself walking faster and chasing trains in the day, always thinking of ways to steal a minute here and there. Lost in a crowd of thousands, running after the same thing. Everybody's exhausted, and everybody's afraid of something. A city filled with stories and memories. Stories of weary fathers returning home after a long commute, and stories of mothers hurriedly preparing her child's lunchbox accepting the fact that perhaps even today, she'll miss her 9:09 local. Stories of struggles and love lost. Stories of sacrifice and lives lost. Stories of you and I. People of different classes and cultures, dreams and ambitions. A city with cities within. A city with cheap restaurants, aesthetic cafes, railway lines and metro bridges, theaters and cinema clubs. A city with art galleries and film posters. A city where you can have a memorable day with art, food, love and conversation. A city with promenades and beaches. A city with memories of your first date, spending all day aimlessly walking the streets of this never ending city. A city with the memories of your first kiss and your first slow dance. A city that taught you everything you know. This city, my whore. I yearn for every part of her. And I try. But I know, she'll never be just mine.

      An essay on summer.

      I'm driving to work. I should focus on the road. But I'm looking at the clouds. I wonder why. I look at those fluffy cotton-like balls often when I'm driving. What's heavier? A kilogram of cloud or a kilogram of cotton? Aren't they both a kilogram? I miss the time when I found that joke funny. It's been a while since I found anything funny honestly. I used to find a lot of things funny. I used to run to my parents to reiterate a joke I heard and be the only one laughing at that joke. I don't run anymore. I drive. I wonder if I should run to work. Will I laugh then? I guess I should just focus on the road.

      I drive the same route everyday. I thought we chose our own path. I don't like this path. There's a lot of traffic. I want to change gears, run at 120. But the auto driver in front of me doesn't want me to. I don't really know who they gave them three wheels. Who came up with the idea? Fuck you. They have this superpower of turning at any point on the road, without giving any kind of signal. It's annoying. I don't like driving behind an auto. So, I overtake. But what's the point? I see another auto in front. Ugh. The driver sticks his arm out. I guess he wants to turn. You see, he can change his path while I have to maintain my course. I think I'm supposed to be patient here, be patient to "figure it out". I used to be patient though. The wait never made me anxious. I could wait hours and hours on just to do nothing. I miss doing nothing. 

      Sometimes, I still I think I'm doing nothing. But I'm driving, I think. I don't remember. I don't remember stuff anymore. Is it just me or do I drink a lot? I miss drinking cold water in the summers. The chill water down my throat eased my mind after a morning long cricket game. I miss summers. It's summer already isn't it? But it's just hot now, you can't call it summer. Feels like I'm in an oven sometimes. I guess I should decrease the temperature and focus on the road. But it still doesn't feel like summer. What did summer mean to you? Did you play all morning and then run to your house to drink that glass of water your mom kept aside for you? I used to chug that glass of cold water and run down to play another game, sometimes cricket, sometimes football, who cared? What was in that glass? Water? Or was it lemonade? I don't remember. I chug beer now.

      I drink from glass, but not from the ones at home, I drink at clubs now. Why do they call it shots? How have I never thought about this? I guess I don't care. I just want to get drunk. I wonder why. I'd like that glass of cold water please. Maybe it'll invigorate me like it did when I was 10. My mom doesn't keep a glass of cold water out for me anymore. I wish she did. But I'm never home now. Well, I don't remember being home in the summers then either. But she still kept that glass out. I wonder why. Is it not the same anymore? I guess it's not. I remember playing in slippers all the time. We didn't wear shoes. I don't play in slippers anymore. Well, I play on turfs now, under floodlights and we need shoes. Oh, don't forget your socks. We work now. I have to wear shoes to work. I don't like driving in shoes. They suffocate my feet. Should I wear slippers again?

      I guess I don't have a choice anymore. I used to have a lot of choices. But I never felt the burden of choosing one. Now, the stress of choosing kills me, even though there aren't many choices really. Do you have a lot of choices? I feel like I'm flowing, one stop to the next. I don't really stop to think anymore. I can't stop the car in the middle of the road. I guess that's why we have traffic. I like thinking in traffic. Makes me forget I'm driving. Do you ever forget you're driving? Or am I just drunk? I'm not a drunk though. I spend more days sober than I do drunk. But the drunk days somehow feel better. I wonder why. I guess I should drink more water in the summers. They even tell you how much water you should drink. It's there, you can google. You can google everything nowadays. But does water numb the pain google? I don't remember spending summers in pain.

      I got hurt a lot while playing but the pain never got to me. I guess that's because my mom would always apply an ointment on the wound. I don't see a wound anymore though. I try to find. Can you help me? There are no wounds. Where do I apply the ointment? I guess mom knows. I should talk to her. But I'm driving now. After all, I'm 21. I drive to most places now. Do all 21 year olds drive? Do they all look at the clouds and travel back in time? I can't be the only 21 year old who does this. Am I? I clear my throat, release the clutch. It's time to press the accelerator. The traffic has cleared.
