`swipe-my-thesis` is a Tinder-like interface for discovering research papers, built during HackUMass 2024. The application allows users to swipe through ArXiv papers, helping researchers discover relevant work in an engaging and intuitive way

We built Swipe My Thesis during HackUMass 2024, a gamified research paper discovery app where users swipe through paper summaries (from ArXiv) and get personalized recommendations based on their interests. You can also share and collaboration by matching with users with similar academic interests, deployment is down but it'll be up soon!
