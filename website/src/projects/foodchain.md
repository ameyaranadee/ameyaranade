`foodchain` is an excessive food listing portal designed for avoiding food wastage. The platform connects restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals who have excess food with those who need it. The system allows users to list surplus food items with details about quantity, location, and pickup times. Other users can browse available food items and arrange for pickup, helping to redistribute food that would otherwise go to waste.

This was also my first hackathon :) We got into Top-25!
