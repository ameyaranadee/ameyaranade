`sel` is a training-free workflow to identify and link salient entities in web articles.
The system uses a combination of named entity recognition and entity linking techniques
to automatically extract and connect important entities from text content.

With a simple API, you can process any web article and get back a structured list of
salient entities with their corresponding Wikipedia links and confidence scores. The
system is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to integrate into existing workflows.
