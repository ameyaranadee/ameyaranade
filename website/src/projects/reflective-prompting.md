`reflective-prompting` explores a cost-efficient alternative to fine-tuned retrieval systems by introducing prompt-based iterative refinement for RAG pipelines. We built a custom PiazzaQA dataset from our course modules on Piazza and compared vanilla RAG, [Self-RAG](https://selfrag.github.io), and our self-refine approach. Our method achieved the best factual accuracy, showing that multi-step reflective prompting can improve retrieval quality and reduce hallucinations without expensive model fine-tuning.
